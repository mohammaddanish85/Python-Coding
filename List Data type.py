# This program demonstrate the concept of list in python.
# Lsi is similar to array in C/Java. List represent the group of elements.
# Difference between list and array is that List can store different types of elements while array can store similar type of elements.


list=[2, 'Danish', 23.5, 'Ariba']                 # Create a list having different elements.

print(list)                                       # Print the entire list.

print(list[2])                                    # Print the 2nd element in list

print(list[1:3])                                  # Print the elements from 1st to 3rd position in list.
