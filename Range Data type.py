r= range(10)                        # Create range number
for i in r: print(i)                # Print values from 0 to 9 (Total 10 numbers)

r= range(2, 22 , 2)                 # Here range is starting from 2 and limit is 22. There will be an increment of 2 (Look at Last number).
for i in r: print(i)                # Print the values starting from 2 and upto 20. (Total 10 values)
